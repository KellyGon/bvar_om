msstart_setup.m: setup matlab file.
msstart2.m:  computes the point estimates of impulse responses, VAR model parameters, etc.
msprob.m:  generates error bands for impulse responses using Sims and Zha (1999).
msprobg.m: plots the error bands for impulse responses.
swz_mardd.m: computes the marginal data density p(Y) for constant-parameter structural VAR models (including over-identified cases
  with linear restrictions).  It may call a few M files that can be downloaded from Tao Zha's Archived Matlab Library ZhaZippedCode in
  http://home.earthlink.net/~tzha02/ProgramCode/programCode.html

ftd_cholesky.m: shows an example of how to impose linear restrictions on the current and lag structures.

The standard prior for quarterly data is based on Sims and Zha (98), which improves upon the Minnesota prior by
  incorporating the cointegration and unit root prior.
The algorithm is based on Waggoner and Zha (03) and Chib (95).
The error bands computation is based on Sims and Zha (99)

A few things that need to change.

The file ftd_cholesky.m gives an example for a four-variable Choleski VAR.

In the file msstart_setup.m, make sure the data range, the sample range, the lag length, etc.  The following variables
  may have to be changed accordingly.

yrBin=1960;   % beginning of the year
qmBin=1;    % begining of the quarter or month
yrFin=2003;   % final year
qmFin=4;    % final month or quarter
vlist = [1 2];    % 1: U; 2: PCE inflation.
varlist={'U', 'Inflation'};
vlistlog = [ ];   % subset of "vlist.  Variables in log level so that differences are in **monthly** growth, unlike R and U which are in annual percent (divided by 100 already).
vlistper = [1 2];           % subset of "vlist"
%------- A specific sample is considered for estimation -------
yrStart=1960;
qmStart=1;
yrEnd=2003;
qmEnd=4;
%------- Prior, etc. -------
lags = 4        % number of lags
