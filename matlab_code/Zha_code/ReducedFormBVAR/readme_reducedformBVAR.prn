The main program: bvar_run.m, which computes out-of-sample forecasts of a BVAR model with the Sims and Zha prior.
  It may call a few M files that can be downloaded from Tao Zha's Archived Matlab Library ZhaZippedCode in
  http://www.atl-res.com/~zha/ProgramCode/programCode.html

The standard prior for quarterly data is based on Sims and Zha (98), which improves upon the Minnesota prior by
  incorporating the cointegration and unit root prior.

A few things that need be changed before running msstart2.m.
In the file bvar_setup.m, make sure the data range, the sample range, the lag length, etc.  The following variables
  may have to be changed accordingly.

yrBin=1960;   % beginning of the year
qmBin=1;    % begining of the quarter or month
yrFin=2003;   % final year
qmFin=4;    % final month or quarter
vlist = [1 2];    % 1: U; 2: PCE inflation.
varlist={'U', 'Inflation'};
vlistlog = [ ];   % subset of "vlist.  Variables in log level so that differences are in **monthly** growth, unlike R and U which are in annual percent (divided by 100 already).
vlistper = [1 2];           % subset of "vlist"
%------- A specific sample is considered for estimation -------
yrStart=1960;
qmStart=1;
yrEnd=2003;
qmEnd=4;
%------- Prior, etc. -------
lags = 4        % number of lags
