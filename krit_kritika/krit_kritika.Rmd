## Remarks:

### 1. Use cloropleth maps with caution

* One may easily manipulate color of a cloropleth map, see

\url{http://faculty.maxwell.syr.edu/mon2ier/e_reprints/StatSci%20Aug2005%20(Lying%20with%20Maps).pdf}

* Most cloropleth maps are just population maps

### 2. The use of instrumental variables is not equal to a pure random experiment

* Try to find measure of African openness exogenous to Africa? Maybe sharp tax reduction in Europe or US?

### 3. Compare import/export structure with Europe and US or China

### 4. Structural changes in fertility?

* Plot your time series!

* Use mvtsplot: \url{http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~rpeng/RR/mvtsplot/}

### 5. Small remarks

* Motivate why you omit Liberia

* Less digits in table 1

* Units of measure in Figure 2 and 3

### 6. OLS and IV are just particular cases of GMM

### 7. Other variables:

* religion
* education
* dictatorship, see \url{https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/27/south-africa-aids-mbeki}
* health, AIDS (probably reverse causality?)

### 8. Present more graphs and less tables

* Plot results of regression, Stata example, \url{http://www.stata.com/meeting/germany14/abstracts/materials/de14_jann.pdf}
